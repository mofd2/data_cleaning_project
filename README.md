# Data Cleaning Project README

This repository contains a data cleaning project implemented in Python using the pandas library. The project focuses on cleaning and transforming names and phone numbers in a dataset, while also considering specific rows based on a special condition.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive data cleaning on a given dataset to ensure consistency and standardization of names and phone numbers. The dataset is expected to have columns for names and phone numbers, along with other relevant information.

## Data Cleaning Steps

The data cleaning process for names and phone numbers involves the following steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: The project addresses any missing values in the name and phone number columns using appropriate techniques, such as imputation or removal, depending on the specific scenario.

2. **Name Cleaning**: The names are cleaned by removing leading/trailing spaces, converting to proper case, and addressing any inconsistent formatting issues or special characters. This step aims to ensure uniformity and readability of names across the dataset.

3. **Phone Number Cleaning**: The phone numbers are standardized to a specific format, such as "123-456-789". Non-digit characters are removed, and the remaining digits are rearranged according to the desired format. This step promotes consistency and ease of use when working with phone numbers.

4. **Applying Special Condition**: Certain rows in the dataset need to be considered based on a special condition. This condition is described as [specify the condition]. The project filters the dataset accordingly to include only the relevant rows, ensuring that the data cleaning process focuses on the required subset of data.

## Running the Project

To run the data cleaning project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., "data_cleaning.ipynb") using Jupyter Notebook or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Jupyter Notebook.

2. Install the required dependencies by executing the following command:
```shell
pip install pandas
```

3. Ensure that the dataset file is available in the same directory you mentioned in the code.

4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform the data cleaning process on the dataset. Modify the notebook as needed to adjust the special condition for row filtering.

6. View the first version of the raw data and the final version to get eyes on differences.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and filtering operations.

## Dataset

Please ensure that you have downloaded the dataset and refer to in the code.

---

At the beginning of your Jupyter Notebook code, you can refer to the dataset as follows:

```python
# Dataset Path
dataset_path = 'dataset_filename.csv'  # Replace 'dataset_filename.csv' with the actual dataset filename

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv(dataset_path)
```

Make sure to replace `'dataset_filename.csv'` with the actual filename of your dataset. This way, it provides clear instructions on where to place the dataset file and how to load it into the code.

Remember to include the correct dataset filename and update the README content to match the actual attachment details and file format.

## Results and Outputs

Describe any notable results or outputs generated from the data cleaning process. This may include summary statistics, visualizations, or any specific insights derived from the cleaned dataset.

## Conclusion

Summarize the key takeaways from the data cleaning project, highlighting the improvements achieved in terms of data quality, consistency, and adherence to the special condition.
